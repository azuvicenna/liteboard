## 📖 About The Project

**LiteBoard** is a desktop application that bundles various classic strategy and card games into a single, resource-efficient executable.

Built using **Tauri** and **Vue 3**, this application is designed to be significantly lighter than traditional Electron-based apps. It focuses on logic, strategy, and casual play without any gambling mechanics. The goal is to preserve the heritage of traditional games like Shogi, Mahjong, and Gaple in a modern, ad-free, and offline environment.

### ✨ Key Features

* **⚡ Ultra Lightweight:** Powered by Tauri (Rust), consuming minimal RAM compared to typical web-based desktop apps.
* **🔌 100% Offline:** No internet connection required. Logic and assets are bundled locally.
* **💾 Local Persistence:** Uses the native file system to save game progress and high scores securely.
* **🧩 State Management:** Complex game rules handled efficiently using Pinia stores.
* **👥 Hotseat Multiplayer:** Play with friends on a single device with "Pass-and-Play" mode (complete with privacy screens for card games).

## 🗺️ Development Roadmap

The games are categorized by technical complexity, ranging from basic logic implementation to advanced AI and physics engines.

### 🟢 Phase 1: Foundation (Basic Logic & Arrays)
*Focus: Establishing Project Structure, Pinia Stores, and Simple Validations.*
- [ ] **Blackjack:** Simple math logic (sum check > 21) without complex board movement.
- [ ] **Mancala (Congklak):** Deterministic array manipulation with circular logic.
- [ ] **Gaple (Dominoes):** Straightforward pattern matching (node A matches node B).

### 🔵 Phase 2: Grid Logic & Intermediate Rules
*Focus: 2D Arrays, Recursion, and Basic "Minimax" concepts.*
- [ ] **Minesweeper:** Implementation of Flood Fill algorithms (Recursion) and grid state management.
- [ ] **Othello (Reversi):** Grid traversal logic (vertical/horizontal/diagonal checks) and tile flipping.
- [ ] **Checkers (Dama):** Diagonal movement restrictions and "forced capture" logic.

### 🟡 Phase 3: Advanced State & UI Interactions
*Focus: Complex Drag-and-Drop, Turn Management, and Trick-Taking Logic.*
- [ ] **Solitaire:** Complex CSS for Drag-and-Drop and strict stack validation rules.
- [ ] **Uno:** Dynamic turn management (Reverse, Skip) and special action handling.
- [ ] **Hearts / Spades:** Trick-taking mechanics requiring basic bot intelligence for card selection.

### 🟠 Phase 4: Algorithm Heavy
*Focus: Generators, Hand Evaluators, and Complex Scoring.*
- [ ] **Sudoku:** Requires Backtracking algorithms for valid puzzle generation and unique solution verification.
- [ ] **Capsa Susun / Poker (Texas Hold'em):** Complex hand evaluation algorithms (detecting Royal Flush, Straights, etc.).
- [ ] **Remi (Rummy):** Set collection and run validation logic.
- [ ] **Hanafuda (Koi-Koi):** Highly specific scoring system (Yaku) and pattern combinations.

### 🔴 Phase 5: Grand Strategy (The Bosses)
*Focus: Deep AI (Minimax/Alpha-Beta Pruning) and Massive Rule Sets.*
- [ ] **Chess:** Complex movement rules (Castling, En Passant) and AI integration.
- [ ] **Shogi (Japanese Chess):** Includes "Drop" mechanics (reusing captured pieces), increasing AI complexity.
- [ ] **Go (Weiqi):** Territory calculation algorithms and "Life and Death" group status.
- [ ] **Mahjong:** Extremely complex rule sets (Riichi, Pon, Chi, Kan, Furiten) and edge-case handling.

### 🟣 Experimental: Physics Based
*Focus: Canvas API & Physics Engines (Matter.js/Box2D).*
*Note: These require stepping outside standard Vue DOM manipulation.*
- [ ] **Carrom (Karambol)**
- [ ] **Billiards**
